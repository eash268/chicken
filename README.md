# Chicken: A Diagnostic Chatbot for Mental Health

Chicken is an AI based chatbot that integrates industry standard mental health questionnaires into a conversational data collection platform and builds robust psychological profiles of its users. We ask patients a few friendly questions through Facebook messenger every day, and then our algorithms analyze their responses over time to calculate results. With enough precise data, we hope to be able to train ML/DL models to find patterns which will potentially aide with diagnoses in the near future.
